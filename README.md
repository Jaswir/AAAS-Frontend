* Tools in your toolbox idea, NAS daily, lots of trials, you'll find a hit
* Solve for their shortcomings (competitors)
* Local Utility
* Take a slice of a complex problem (Google Search better version => Only Weather vertical, everybody looks up the weather...)

* Look For Problems
Work backwards from a problem

* Make things slightly more efficiënt
"I think a lot of how products add value to the world is: they make things slightly more efficiënt"

* Demand perfection from products

* Think Small:  **Side** project

* Solve locally
Build something that solves a problem that you have.
Life becomes easier. Feedback will come natural. Over time you'll use
your own product and figure things out

**"There's a lot of low hanging fruits out there, go get them!"**
