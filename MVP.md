# The Problem
Sometimes I feel like I am not good the way I am, like I am weird and it is a bad thing. 
In these cases I want to be inspired / motivated that I am good and want to see inspiring/motivational Quotes from 
Inspiring Autistic people like Elon Musk.

So I want an API that tells me quotes from Inspiring / Autistic people that relate to how I feel.
