# The Problem
Sometimes I feel like I am not good the way I am, like I am different and that is a bad thing. 
In these cases I want to be inspired / motivated that I am good how I am and want to see inspiring/motivational Quotes from 
Inspiring Autistic people like Elon Musk.

So I want an API that tells me quotes from Inspiring / Autistic people that relate to how I feel. 


Me feeling bad cause I offended someone =>

 “To anyone I have offended, I just want to say I reinvented electric cars and I’m sending people to Mars on a rocket ship. Did you think I was also going to be a chill, normal dude?”

 - Elon musk
